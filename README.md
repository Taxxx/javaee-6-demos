# Description

Demo examples to show my knowledge and experience about several Java EE 6
technologies and frameworks. The repo is not completed, be patient, bit by 
bit I will be adding more technologies.

Most of the demos will be developed using `maven` as a tool to manage dependencies
and development lifecycle (from start to test, run and package as .war files)
