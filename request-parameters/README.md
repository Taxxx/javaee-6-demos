# Request Parameters Servlet

In this example, we will create a HTTP servlet able to read request parameters.
The servlet will be based in our previous simple HTTP servlet.

# Instructions

We aren't using any JSP page to display the result to the user, so, the servlet
will write simple plain text to show that it is working, that's all.

## Dependencies

In this case, we have the same dependencies as in our previous demo: Java EE and
Jetty maven plugin.

## Writing the servlet

**TO BE COMPLETED**

# Run

To run this example, just type `mvn jetty:run`, or even simpler, `mvn` (the default
maven goal is configured as `jetty:run` for your convenience).
