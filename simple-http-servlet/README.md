# Simple Http Servlet

In this example, we will create a simple http servlet, without a web descriptor, just to
show how Java EE 6 annotations can save developers some boiler plate XML code.

# Run

To run this example, just type `mvn jetty:run`, or even simpler, `mvn` (the default
maven goal is configured as `jetty:run` for your convenience).
