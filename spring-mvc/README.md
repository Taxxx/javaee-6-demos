# restfulmvc

In this demo, we will create an application to show the use 
of the Spring MVC framework for creating RESTful services.

It will be a simple web application, without persistence, but a
complete Spring MVC application where, instead of render responses
with a JSP page, the response will be in JSON format, to be
consumed as a Web Service
