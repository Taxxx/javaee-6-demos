# restfulmvc

In this demo, we will create an application to show the use 
of the Spring MVC framework for creating RESTful services.

It will be a simple web application, without persistence, but a
complete Spring MVC application where, instead of render responses
with a JSP page, the response will be in JSON format, to be
consumed as a Web Service

# Instructions

The application will be a typical CRUD one, and it will manage a 
list of houses, flats, cottages, ... These kind of properties 
managed by a real state agency.

## Steps

- Define URI's to access properties
- Create an empty MVC controller to reply to queries (list and get)
- Create tests to exercise the query controller
- Implement the controller
- Create an empty MVC controller to reply to commands (create, delete 
and update)
- Create tests to exercise the controller
- Implement it
